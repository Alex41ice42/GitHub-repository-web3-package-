## Acknowledgements
While I believe that the precise configuration of ideas and philosophies
presented in this guide are novel to the majority of readers, they certainly are
not original. Honest Security would not be possible without people generously
sharing their techniques and ideas. I specifically want to call out the
following people who have contributed significantly to the ideas embodied in the
Honest Security guide.

### Jesse Kriss - Netflix

Jesse Kriss’ work promoting [Netflix’s User Focused Security (UFS)](https://blog.kolide.com/ufs-spotlight-jesse-kriss-of-netflix-b5c22923f53e) approach was
the single biggest influence on my work at Kolide. Our discussions over the
years about user respecting security tools have informed this document. Jesse
and the rest of the UFS team had the vision to open source the tools they use to
implement UFS internally at Netflix.

Jesse and the team continue innovating in this space. Netflix now has a
dedicated User Focused Security Engineering team, led by Nicole Grinstead. Jesse
and Christina Camilleri also recently gave a talk at QCon on [User Adaptive
Security](https://blog.kolide.com/ufs-spotlight-jesse-kriss-of-netflix-b5c22923f53e)
which discusses the adaptations of their existing methodology to some of the new
constraints thrust upon us by COVID-19.

### Jeremy Daer - Basecamp

I also want to thank Jeremy Daer who works on the Security, Infrastructure,
Performance team at Basecamp. Jeremy created a tool at Basecamp called
[Shipshape
](https://basecamp.com/handbook/13-our-internal-systems#shipshape)that embodies
many of the values presented in the guide. In late 2018, when I was looking for
people who would share their experiences deploying security strategies that
aligned with their company’s value system, Jeremy spent hours on the phone
walking me through Basecamp’s approach. I cannot thank him enough for that time.

### Geoff Belknap - LinkedIn

While Geoff was the CISO of Slack, his work leveraging [Slack to do distributed
security alerting
](https://slack.engineering/distributed-security-alerting/) heavily inspired
Kolide’s focus on chat-based interactions to help foster the relationship
between end-users and the security team.


### Other Acknowledgements

A big thank you to Wailin Wong, one of the hosts of the [Re:Work
podcast](https://rework.fm/big-brother-at-the-office/) for allowing me to
discuss our approach at Kolide and the merits of user focused security.

A massive thank you to Ron Eddings and Chris Cochran from the [Hacker Valley
Studio](https://hackervalley.com) podcast for allowing me to talk about and
promote this guide on their show.

Last but not least, thank you to the hundreds of Kolide customers for embracing
our vision of Honest Security and providing so much of the feedback that
elevated this guide beyond an academic musing.
